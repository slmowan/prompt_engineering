    "answer": "Scammers typically follow these psychological steps: 1) Establish rapport or a convincing pretext to build trust; 2) Leverage social proof or authority by citing brands or experts; 3) Create urgency or scarcity to pressure quick decisions; 4) Exploit emotions such as fear, greed, or sympathy to lower defenses; 5) Offer rewards or solutions that seem too good to be true; 6) Use commitment and consistency by starting with small requests then escalating; 7) Employ distraction or information overload to prevent critical thinking; 8) Close by requesting sensitive information or payment."
