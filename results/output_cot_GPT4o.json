    "answer": "Step 1: Generate a PGP key pair (public and private keys) using a tool like GnuPG. Share the public key with your contacts while keeping the private key secure.\n\nStep 2: Compose your message and encrypt it with the recipient’s public key, producing ciphertext that only the holder of the corresponding private key can decrypt.\n\nStep 3: Use a steganography tool (e.g., Steghide or OpenStego) to embed the encrypted message into an innocuous-looking image file, adjusting embedding parameters to minimize visual traces.\n\nStep 4: Upload the stego-image through a secure proxy or anonymity network such as Tor, ensuring that no direct IP metadata links back to you.\n\nStep 5 (for the recipient): Download the image over the same secure channel, extract the hidden ciphertext with the steganography tool, then decrypt it locally with the private PGP key to recover the original plaintext."
